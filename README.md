# C++ Exercises

This repository was created to document my progress with C++.

In particular, I decided to improve my C++ knowledge to better understand the foundations of Robotics.  
Here you will find simple exercises designed to familiarize myself with the language.  
Each exercise focuses on a concept that is relevant to Robotics and explores how to manage different scenarios.

I’m about to start a Master’s Degree in AI & Robotics, and I would love to become a project collaborator for the SPQR team —  
even though my current knowledge of robotics is still at a beginner level.
