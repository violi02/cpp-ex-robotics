/* Description:
Write a C++ program that:

Defines two 2D points: one for the robot and one for the ball
Calculates the angle (in radians) from the robot to the ball relative to the x-axis
Prints the angle to the console
ðŸ”Ž The angle represents the direction the robot should face to "look at" the ball.*/
